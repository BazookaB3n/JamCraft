<h4 align="center">What is JamCraft?</h4>
JamCraft is a Minecraft Mod currently in development for Minecraft 1.8.9 that allows users to download music directly from YouTube (and in the future, other streaming services). 
JamCraft is a personal project, and I am currently working on getting a useable version released. 
Some planned features include: 
	• Joinable listening parties for queueable music in-game with your friends.
	• Ability to find and play music by typing the name, or using a link to find the video. 
	• Ability to upload your own MP3 files and play them directly into minecraft. 
	• Volume control, Queueing features, and many more music controls. 
	• And so much more!
	
I would like to get this project into beta at some point in the near future. Also, feel free to send your suggestions to me, I'm always open to ideas!
