<h3 align="center">What is JamCraft?</h4>
JamCraft is a Minecraft Mod currently in development for Version 1.8.9 that allows users to download music directly from YouTube (and in the future, other streaming services). 
<br>
JamCraft is a personal project, and I am currently working on getting a semi-stable version released. 
<br>
Some planned features include: <ul>
<li>Joinable listening parties for queueable music in-game with your friends.</li>
<li>Ability to find and play music by typing the name, or using a link to find the video.</li>
<li>Ability to upload your own MP3 files and play them directly into minecraft. </li>
<li>Volume control, Queueing features, and many more music controls. </li>
<li>And so much more!</li>
</ul>

I am looking to get this project into beta at some point in the near future. Also, feel free to send your suggestions to me, I'm always open to ideas!
